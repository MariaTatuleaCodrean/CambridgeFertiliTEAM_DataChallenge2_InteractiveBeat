## Introduction
Motivation for IVF research.

To solve this problem, we have designed three MATLAB live scripts that ... . The live scripts allow the user to reproduce and interact with the data published by (reference), and also to explore additional features.

Although the Live Scripts were primarily designed for researchers in the field of IVF and infertility, the scripts can also be used by the general public to gain a better understanding of the link between sperm motility and infertility.

The project meets the requirements of the hackathon in the following ways:

- **Specific**- Justification.

- **Measurable**- Justification.

- **Achievable**- Justification.

- **Relevant**- Justification.

- **Timebound**- Justification.


## Background

Brief background on the field of IVF research with focus on sperm motility diagnostics and investigations.

The live scripts use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow easy manipulation of input variables. There are sliders for:

* sperm ID;

* timepoint;

* number of modes in waveform reconstruction




## Team

The team is comprised of PhD Students and Postdocs from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) at the University of Cambridge. The project was conceived, developed, coded and written up by the group.
